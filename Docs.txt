About:
In this repository, I have two programs: a mobile banking application and an online store. Both programs run in the console for viewing outcomes. 
To interact with the programs, a prompt window will open after a 10-second delay, allowing the user to access the console.

Mobile Banking:
In the mobile banking application, you can make deposits, withdrawals, and view your balance. The program ensures that you cannot withdraw more 
than you have in your account, guaranteeing that your balance will always be positive or zero.

Mobile Shopper:
In the Mobile Shopper application, users can pick items from the store and add them to their cart by selecting the item’s ID number. 
At any point, users can view their cart to see the items they’ve added, along with the total dollar amount for all items in the cart.

Extensions:
None

Questions for Assignment:
Exploring Conditional Statements and Loops
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to familiarize students with conditional statements and loops in JavaScript and enhance their 
problem-solving skills using these control structures.

Problem Statement: You are tasked with creating a JavaScript program that simulates a simple online shopping experience. The program should 
allow users to browse products, add them to a cart, and calculate the total cost of their purchase.

Task 1: Implement a conditional statement to check if a user is logged in before allowing them to add items to the cart.

Task 2: Use a loop to display the list of available products to the user and add functionality for users to add products to their cart.

Task 3: Calculate the total cost of the items in the cart and display it to the user.

Expected Outcomes:

Upon completion of this assignment, students should be able to understand how to use conditional statements to control program flow based on 
certain conditions.
Students should be able to implement loops to iterate through arrays and perform repetitive tasks efficiently.
Students will gain practical experience in solving real-world problems using JavaScript control structures.


Exploring Functions in JavaScript
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to deepen students' understanding of functions in JavaScript and their various applications in 
solving programming problems.

Problem Statement: Your task is to develop a JavaScript program that simulates a simple banking system. The program should include functions 
to perform basic banking operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry.

Task 1: Create a function to handle deposits into a bank account.

Task 2: Implement a function to handle withdrawals from a bank account, ensuring sufficient balance.

Task 3: Develop a function to check the current balance of the account.

Expected Outcomes:

After completing this assignment, students should demonstrate proficiency in creating and using functions to perform specific tasks.
Students should understand the importance of function modularity and reusability in programming.
This assignment will enable students to apply their knowledge of functions to practical scenarios, such as banking operations, thereby enhancing 
their problem-solving skills.
